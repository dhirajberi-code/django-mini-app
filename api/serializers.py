'''
At the top of the file we have imported Django REST Frameworkâ€™s serializers class and our
own models. Then we created a PostSerializer and added a Meta class where we specified
which fields to include and explicitly set the model to use. There are many ways to customize a
serializer but for common use cases, such as a basic blog, this is all we need.
